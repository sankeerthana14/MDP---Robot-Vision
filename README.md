# Multi-disciplinary Project - Robot Vision Component

In the Multi-disciplinary project from NTU, we were grouped into groups of 10 and by the end of the semester we had to build a functioning robot that would successfully pass 2 challenges:

1. Image Detection Task - Navigating its path around a maze while correctly detecting the image pasted on the obstacles in the shortest time possible.
2. Speed Task - The robot needed to speed up as fast as possible and then go around an abstacle before returning back to its starting point within the shortest possible time.

This github repo contains the final code for the Robot's Vision. The model implemented was YOLOv5. This project involved me collecting the data (images), processing them, training the model, optimizing the model and deploying the model into Raspberry Pi.
